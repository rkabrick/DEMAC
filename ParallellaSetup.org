* Building a Parallella Cluster (DEMAC Cluster)
This is a guide on how to properly configure a parallella cluster of 4 nodes. The steps listed should
apply to a cluster of 24 nodes however the process should not differ at all for lesser or more nodes.

*NOTE*: This guide uses a parallella head node however we will be transitioning the head node responsibility
        to a non-parallella host in order to properly implement NFS

** Preliminaries
*** Required Materials
For each board you need the following materials
- Micro USB Power Cable
- Micro SD Cards (\ge8Gb)
- A nice Colombian guy to 3D Print a kick ass rack mount for the boards
- Fans (Optional)
- Router
- Switch (Optional)

** Setting up master SD Card
Although it should go without saying, you have to use a computer that will not be in the cluster to prep SD Cards

*NOTE*: We will be setting up the first SD card seperately from the others to maximize efficiency by avoiding seperate
        program installs for each SD card in the cluster.

Outline:
 - Download vanilla OS from Parallella Website
 - Make necessary network configurations
 - Install programs (ie. MPICH2, Ansible, etc)
 - Remove SD Card from Parallella and write the image from the card to an external Computer
 - Clone the modified OS to remaining SD cards that will be used

1.) Download whichever operating system you would like (Headless vs HDMI Support) from [[https://www.parallella.org/create-sdcard/][here]]

2.) Navigate to your Downloads Directory
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd Downloads
#+END_SRC

3.) Extract the File
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gunzip -k parabuntu-2016.11.1-headless-z7010.img.gz
#+END_SRC

4.) Figure out where your SD Card is on the machine... It helps to look at the output of this function by volume space.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lsblk
#+END_SRC

For me, it was located at */dev/mmcblk0*

5.) Write the image to the SD Card
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dd bs=4M if=parabuntu=2016.11.1-headless-z7010.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=64k
#+END_SRC

6.) Load SD Card in Parallella

*** Setting up Network Settings (Router + Switch)
**** Find IP Address and Connect Via SSH
The following instructions will detail how to set up your network so you can easily ssh
into the headless OS

1.) Connect the one Parallella that should have an OS now to the router

2.) Login to your routers configuration page by typing the IP Address of the router
    to your web browser. It should look something like this...

[[/home/rkabrick/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-25%2013-23-09.png][Router Interface]]

You need to know the login information for the router. If you are using a router that has
been previously set up look up how to set it back to factory defaults and use the default
login to access the page.

3.) Navigate to the *Network* tab

4.) Click on DCHP Client List to see a list of IP's given out by the router

5.) Look for an entry in this list titled *Parallella*

6.) Make a note of the IP Address of the Parallella Board
 - /For the sake of this tutorial we will say the IP Address given out by DHCP is 192.168.10.95/

**** Set a Static IP
DHPC will continue to assign new IP Addresses that will be troublesome to keep track of. For this
reason we will give the Parallella its own static IP Address so there is never a guess of how to
connect to each node.

1.) From an external computer, ssh into the Parallella
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh parallella@192.168.10.95
#+END_SRC

2.) Using any text editor available to you from the Parabuntu OS, alter the file located at
    */etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0*
    to look like the following

[[file:Building%20a%20Parallella%20Cluster%20(DEMAC%20Cluster)/Screenshot%2520from%25202018-11-29%252010-28-58_2018-11-29_10-32-41.png]]#+DOWNLOADED: file:///home/rkabrick/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-29%2010-38-33.png @ 2018-11-29 10:38:52
[[file:Building%20a%20Parallella%20Cluster%20(DEMAC%20Cluster)/Screenshot%2520from%25202018-11-29%252010-38-33_2018-11-29_10-38-52.png]]

 - Replace the *address* line with whatever you would like the static IP to be

3.) Edit your hosts file (*/etc/hosts*) and add all of your desired static IPs depending on how many nodes you will have
    My *hosts* file looks like:
#+DOWNLOADED: file:///home/rkabrick/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-29%2010-40-11.png @ 2018-11-29 10:41:34
[[file:Building%20a%20Parallella%20Cluster%20(DEMAC%20Cluster)/Screenshot%2520from%25202018-11-29%252010-40-11_2018-11-29_10-41-34.png]]

- From the above image you can see that I have inputted 24 addresses, each followed by what I want their hostname to be (*NOPA##*)

4.) Confirm that you can now access the internet from the Parallella Board using any method you see fit

*** Install Software
The following instructions are to be completed on the parallella board not your own computer

**** Updating Archives
By default, if you try to run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get update
#+END_SRC
or try any command that uses the apt repositories you will likely get an error. This is caused by the Parabuntu OS being based on an
older version of Ubuntu. For this reason it is necessary to update the apt sources so we can proceed with software installs

In order to link the old sources to the parallella you need to run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
#+END_SRC

Now you should be able to run sudo apt-get update with minimal errors. Don't be discouraged if there are a few
sources that still return errors... just as long as it is noticeably less than the initial /sudo apt-get update/
before the *sed* command.

**** Ansible
Ansible is an incredibly useful automation tool that allows for easy cluster management by sending a single command
to each board present in the cluster. When you start getting above ~5 nodes it isn't practical to update each node
every time you wish to add/modify an aspect of the OS.

*NOTE*: Ansible only has to be installed on one machine. You can choose to install it on the head Parallella or a PC that
        is seperate from the cluster. I will do the latter.

*NOTE*: I may end up looking more into Ansible and seeing how to implement roles/tasks however for now we will only be
        using it to issue commands 'manually' to each node

*NOTE*: Ansible only has to be installed on one machine, but installing it on the master SD card image will result in every node
        having the software. This is not a problem, just a note.

- *Install*:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install ansible
#+END_SRC

- *Configuration*
Ansible uses what is called an '/inventory file/' to know what machines to communicate with and how to do so.

By default, Ansible will look for this file in: */etc/ansible/hosts*
    - If you wish to use a different file you will have to pass *-i* followed by your inventory file each
      time you issue an ansible command

Because we already set up our */etc/hosts* file to house all of the static IPs of the cluster we will have to
copy that list over to the /inventory file/. I inserted the following into the beginning of my inventory file:

#+DOWNLOADED: file:///home/rkabrick/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-29%2011-01-57.png @ 2018-11-29 11:02:18
[[file:Building%20a%20Parallella%20Cluster%20(DEMAC%20Cluster)/Screenshot%2520from%25202018-11-29%252011-01-57_2018-11-29_11-02-18.png]]

As you can see I have set the group name of all of the nodes to be *pNodes*. The group name is used every time you wish
to issue an Ansible command. Feel free to name it whatever you would like.

Now you should move on to the installation of MPICH2. However, once all of your nodes are up an running return to this section
so you can test Ansible by issuing the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ansible pNodes -m ping
#+END_SRC

You will know what nodes are successfully integrated into the cluster if they return a pong to the ping request:

#+DOWNLOADED: file:///home/rkabrick/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-29%2011-07-24.png @ 2018-11-29 11:07:42
[[file:Building%20a%20Parallella%20Cluster%20(DEMAC%20Cluster)/Screenshot%2520from%25202018-11-29%252011-07-24_2018-11-29_11-07-42.png]]

**** MPICH2
MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. This is what allows computation to be split up between the nodes in the
cluster to significantly improve performance.

*NOTE*: Unlike Ansible, MPI needs to be installed on each node in order to function properly. This means that you
        must install it on the Parallella and not an external PC.

1.) Download MPICH2
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/3.2.1/mpich-3.2.1.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

2.) Navigate to the directory containing the file and extract it
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tar -xvf mpich-3.1.2.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

3.) cd Into the MPICH Folder
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd mpich-3.1.2
#+END_SRC

4.) Run the Configuration (This may take a bit)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./configure
#+END_SRC

When the configuration is done you should get a /Configuration Complete/ message

5.) Build MPICH (This will also take a while)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make; sudo make install
#+END_SRC

If your build was successful you should be able to type *mpiexec --version* and get
a response with the current version of mpi installed on your hardware.

**** Clone the DEMAC Repository
The DEMAC repository contains the necessary files to test and maintain the cluster. Clone it by issuing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/rkabrick/DEMAC
#+END_SRC

*** Write Master Image to Remaining Nodes
Now that all of the legwork has been done on one of the nodes, we will be copying the modified OS image to
an external PC so we can copy it to the remaining SD cards.

1.) Remove SD card from Parallella and insert it into an external PC (Linux)

2.) Open a terminal window

3.) Find the name of the device
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo fdisk -l
#+END_SRC

ex.) Mine was mmcblk0

4.) Unmount the device
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0
#+END_SRC

5.) Create an image of the device
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=~/parallellaMaster.img
#+END_SRC

I named my new image *parallellaMaster.img*

6.) Refer to previous instruction on how to write an image to the remaining SD cards

*NOTE*: Make sure you use the new image and not the Vanilla OS... otherwise all of the installations and configurations we did will have been for nothing.

**** Change Static IP of New Nodes
Because each node will originally have the same network configuration as the original modified node we need to change the static IPs
so that they correspond to whatever number node they are.

1.) Refer back to the steps on setting up a static IP

2.) Modify the eth0 file so that the *address* line reads a different IP for each of the nodes

**** SSH
In order for the nodes to communicate we need to SSH into every node from EVERY other node we will be using. Otherwise, when we
go to use MPI we will get errors because the nodes do not have permission to access one another.

Depending on how many nodes you have you may want to do this manually however it is more efficient to utilize the bash script in
the DEMAC directory. The script is called *sshCopyId.sh*. It is a very readable script however you will have to modify it with
the appropriate IP Addresses of each node in the cluster.

*** Running Our First Program
Assuming you have made it this far, we can now run our first program on the cluster.

1.) Run the following command to ping each ARM core on the Parallella
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mpiexec -machinefile ./DEMAC/machinefile -n 48 ./DEMAC/mpi_hello_world
#+END_SRC

*NOTE*: The number that follows the *-n* flag corresponds to the number of processes that will be run by MPI. Because
        each ARM chip has 2 cores, that number should be (2 * # of Nodes). You can do less than this number however if
        you exceed it, MPI will throw an error

** Optional
*** dotfiles (Nicer looking/functioning Terminal)

I don't like the lack of functionality and appearance of the basic terminals. I found a good video on
a zsh and tmux workflow that I think is much nicer to work with in ubuntu's terminal.

The video can be found [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgDz_9i2nwc][here]]

To install these dotfiles follow these steps:

1.) ssh into the board you wish to change
2.) Clone and deploy the repository
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/Parth/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./deploy
#+END_SRC
3.) Follow the scripts and answer yes to every one except the backing up of original dotfiles
4.) Exit ssh connection and reload the board
5.) Re-login to the same board and hit enter

*** Port Forwarding
It may be necessary to set up port forwarding if you wish to connect to the cluster from a network
other than the LAN.

To do this, we will enable port forwarding on our Trendnet Router

1.) Navigate to your routers configuration interface (Type its IP Address into a web browser)
2.) Look for a *port forwarding* menu in either the /setup/ or /advanced/ sections of the site (Trendnet Routers house this section in the Gaming submenu)
3.) Input the LAN IP Address that you wish for traffic to be forwarded to (My head node's LAN IP is 192.168.10.101)
4.) Because we are going to be using ssh we will have to set it up on *TCP port 22* as ssh is handled by port 22
5.) Make sure you enable the entry and save your new settings
6.) Find your Routers External IP Address and make note of it.
7.) Test to see if you can connect from outside your LAN by issuing the following commands
